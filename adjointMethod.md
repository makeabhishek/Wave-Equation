# Taylor Series
Taylor's theorem (actually discovered first by Gregory) states that any function satisfying certain conditions can be expressed as a Taylor series. Taylor series is a series expansion of a function about a point. \
A one-dimensional Taylor series is an expansion of a real function $f(x)$ about a point $x=a$ is given by \
$f(x) = f(a) + \frac{f'(a)}{2\!}(x-a)^2 + + \frac{f''(a)}{3\!}(x-a)^3 + \cdot \cdot \cdot + \frac{f^{n}(a)}{n\!}(x-a)^n +  \cdot \cdot \cdot$ \
If $a=0$, the expansion is known as a **Maclaurin series**. \

A Taylor series of a real function in two variables $f(x,y)$ is given by \
$f(x + \Delta x, y + \Delta y) = f(x,y) + [f\_x (x,y)\Delta x + f_y\ (x,y) \Delta y] + \frac{1}{2\!} [(\Delta x)^2 f\_{xx} (x,y) + 2 \Delta x \Delta y f\_{xy} (x,y) + (\Delta y)^2 f_{yy} (x,y)] +$ \
$\frac{1}{3\!}[(\Delta x)^3 f\_{xxx} (x,y) + 3 (\Delta x)^2 \Delta y f\_{xxy}(x,y) + 3 \Delta x (\Delta y)^2 f\_{xyy}(x,y) + (\Delta y)^3 f\_{yyy}(x,y)] + \cdot \cdot \cdot$ \
