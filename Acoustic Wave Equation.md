Wave generates with particle vibration. One should take a note that vibration and simple harmonic motion is not a wave. Wave only occurs when there is transfer of energy from one particle to other.

The wave equation is a second-order, partial differential equation (PDE) in which the $u$ (unknown: displacement or presure) satisfies:
**The 1-D acoustic wave equation**
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}= v^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} $$

**The 2-D acoustic wave equation**
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}= \frac{k^2}{\rho^2}\bigg[ \rho \nabla \cdot \bigg(\frac{1}{rho} \nabla u\bigg) \bigg] + f $$

where $\rho$=\rho(x,z)$ is the density, $k$=k(x,z)$ is bulk modulus, $u$=u(x,z,t)$ is the pressure field, $f$ is the source function and $\nabla$ is a _nabla_, _Del_ operator given by 

$$ \nabla =\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\vec {e}}_{i}{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}}=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}},\ldots ,{\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n}}}\right)$$

Equation (1) expands to


**The 3-D acoustic wave equation**
